# User Stories
 
M – I have a habit of being late for class. I want to create a playlist which ends when I need to leave for class. This is because I get stressed by waiting for an alarm go off. 

 

XL – I am a Spotify user who likes to listen to fast music while leaving for work in the morning, but not as soon as I wake up. I would like to generate a playlist which starts out being relaxing and then gets more intense the closer I am to leaving for work. I will be able to sense how soon work is just by the feeling of the song. 

 

L – I am planning a New Year’s party and I want my favorite part of my favorite song to play at exactly midnight. I don’t want to manually figure out when to start playing the song, so it lines up. This app will help me ensure the moment is perfect. 

 

L – I am setting a timer to signal the end of my workout. I want the playlist to end with my favorite song. This will motivate me to finish my workout strong.
