# Project #1: Interactive Map of UWO (with Plants)
## Motivation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The University of Oshkosh used to have an interactive map that people could view which showed every tree on campus and its name (yes, trees have names). The interactive map was removed and we would like to bring it back as it would be helpful for biology and ecology majors. It would also list the different plants on campus and where to find them.

## Features
* **Interactive map with trees and their names**
	* As stated in the motivation, the app would be an interactive map of the trees and their names on the UWO campus.
* **Click on a plant**
	* There will be a list of plants that exist on campus and the user is able to click any one of them to get information about the plant and where to find it on campus.
* **GPS (Air-tag like) Feature**
	* If a user wanted to visit a specific plant, they would be able to select one location of where it exists on campus and get directions to it.
	* But as our group was thinking, we wanted it to be less like a map with the typical directions that you may expect *(like below)*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and more like an Air-Tag-like UI *(like below)*

* **Application still acts like a normal interactive map**
	* Still functions like a normal interactive map in the case that students also want to find specific buildings.
* To recap, this application would have a GPS feature, filters for specified locations, the ability to learn about plants, the ability to set a route for a walk, and a search feature to locate a very specific type of plant.

# Project #2: Study App for Computer Science Students
## Motivation
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As computer science students, we know that note-taking for classes where the slides are filled with screenshots of code can be quite a drag and get in the way of studying. In order to combat this, we want to create an app that helps CS students take better notes, and provide them with a concise location for accessing resources related to topics they may encounter in class. Overall, it would be a general study app specificially aimed towards CS students.

## Features
* **Ability to run code within the app**
	* The app would provide students with the convenience of being able to write / copy-paste code into the app that can easily be ran. It makes it convenient for students to run code without the need of having to boot up their computer/laptop to run an IDE.
* **Text Recognition to get code**
	* Our application would be able to take in a screenshot of code or even a whole slide set and extract different code bits that exist for the student to run within the app (as stated in the previous feature). 
* **Concise Location for Resources**
	* Sometimes finding a good resource can be a pain and a student may have multiple tabs from different sources about different topics. Our app would have a search feature that allows students to look up any sort of topic and provide relevant information to help the student study.
	* If more information were desired by the student, we would provide links to other resources.
*  **Visualization of Data Structures and Algorithms**
	* As a contintuation of the last feature mentioned, data structures and algorithm resources that exist in the application would have interactive visualizations to help deepen the student's understanding.
*  **Notebook / Note taking**
	* Our application would also be a notebook that allows students to write notes  in. The key difference between our note-taking feature when compared to others is that ours will be designed specifically for computer science students. This means it would have a good minimal design and allow code bits to exist alongside a student's notes. There's also potential for the code to be ran within the notebook itself for the student's convenience as well.
*  **Flashcard Feature**
	* Our application allows the creation of flashcards to help computer science students study. It would allow the student to easily create visualizations on the flashcards (like if a student wanted to have one side of the flashcard have a tree with the question: "What is the preorder traversal of this tree?").

# Logistics
* **Means of Communcation**
	* Our team would be communicating through a **Discord server that we made specifically for the group project**. That would be our main method of communication and the occasional in-person meeting.
* **Meeting Date and Times**
	* Every week - **Wednesdays @ 5:30 pm** and **Thursdays @ 4:40pm**
